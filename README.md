## 🔧 Repository Structure

This repository leverages Turborepo for streamlined monorepo management. The primary components include:

*   `packages/adk`: Contains the core `@iqai/adk` library, which is the fundamental package for building agents.
*   `apps/examples`: Provides a suite of practical example applications demonstrating various ADK features and best practices.

## 🚦 Getting Started

Begin developing AI agents with ADK TypeScript by following these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Node.js (LTS version recommended; refer to `package.json` `engines` for specific version requirements).
*   Valid API keys for your selected LLM provider(s) (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

### 2. Package Installation
Integrate the `@iqai/adk` package into your project using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @iqai/adk

# Using yarn
yarn add @iqai/adk

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @iqai/adk
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory. Add your API keys to this file; ADK will automatically load these environment variables.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```

### 4. Your First Agent Implementation

ADK provides **AgentBuilder**, a fluent interface that simplifies agent creation and eliminates boilerplate code. Here's the simplest way to get started:

#### Simple One-Line Agent
```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from '@iqai/adk';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables from .env
dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Simplest possible usage - one line to create and run an agent
  const response = await AgentBuilder
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash") // Supports gpt-4, claude-3-5-sonnet, gemini-pro, etc.
    .ask("What is the primary function of an AI agent?");
  
  console.log(`Agent Response: ${response}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

#### Agent with Instructions and Session Management
```typescript
import { AgentBuilder, InMemorySessionService } from '@iqai/adk';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Create an agent with custom instructions and session persistence
  const { agent, runner, session } = await AgentBuilder
    .create("my_assistant")
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
    .withDescription("A helpful AI assistant")
    .withInstruction("You are an AI assistant. Provide concise and accurate responses.")
    .withSession(new InMemorySessionService(), "user-123", "my-first-app")
    .build();

  if (!runner || !session) {
    throw new Error("Failed to create runner and session");
  }

  // Run conversation with the agent
  for await (const event of runner.runAsync({
    userId: "user-123",
    sessionId: session.id,
    newMessage: {
      parts: [{ text: "What is the primary function of an AI agent?" }]
    }
  })) {
    if (event.content?.parts?.[0]?.text && !event.partial) {
      console.log(`Agent: ${event.content.parts[0].text}`);
    }
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage Examples

AgentBuilder makes it easy to create sophisticated agents with tools, memory, and multi-agent workflows.

### Agent with Custom Tools
Enable agents to perform specific actions or interact with external services using custom-defined tools.

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder, BaseTool, GoogleSearch, HttpRequestTool } from '@iqai/adk';
import type { ToolContext } from '@iqai/adk';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// Define a custom tool for currency conversion
class CurrencyConverterTool extends BaseTool {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  getDeclaration() {
    return {
      name: 'currency_converter',
      description: 'Converts an amount from one currency to another',
      parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          amount: { 
            type: 'number',
            description: 'The amount to convert'
          },
          fromCurrency: { 
            type: 'string', 
            description: 'Source currency code (e.g., USD)' 
          },
          toCurrency: { 
            type: 'string', 
            description: 'Target currency code (e.g., EUR)' 
          }
        },
        required: ['amount', 'fromCurrency', 'toCurrency']
      }
    };
  }

  async runAsync(
    args: { amount: number; fromCurrency: string; toCurrency: string },
    context: ToolContext
  ) {
    // Placeholder for actual conversion logic (e.g., API call to a finance service)
    if (args.fromCurrency === 'USD' && args.toCurrency === 'EUR') {
      const converted = args.amount * 0.92;
      return `${args.amount} ${args.fromCurrency} = ${converted.toFixed(2)} ${args.toCurrency}`;
    }
    return `Conversion rate not available for ${args.fromCurrency} to ${args.toCurrency}`;
  }
}

async function main() {
  // Simple agent with tools using AgentBuilder
  const response = await AgentBuilder
    .create("financial_assistant")
    .withModel("gpt-4")
    .withDescription("A financial assistant that can convert currencies and search for information")
    .withInstruction("You are a financial assistant. Use your tools to help with currency conversions and research.")
    .withTools(
      new CurrencyConverterTool(),
      new GoogleSearch(),
      new HttpRequestTool()
    )
    .ask("Convert 100 USD to EUR and find the latest EUR exchange rates");

  console.log(`Financial Agent: ${response}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Multi-Agent System
Create specialized agents that can work together in sequential or parallel workflows.

```typescript
import { AgentBuilder } from '@iqai/adk';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

async function main() {
  // Create specialized agents using AgentBuilder
  const researchAgent = await AgentBuilder
    .create("researcher")
    .withModel("gpt-4")
    .withDescription("Specializes in research and fact-finding")
    .withInstruction("You are a research specialist. Gather accurate, detailed information about topics.")
    .build();

  const summaryAgent = await AgentBuilder
    .create("summarizer")
    .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
    .withDescription("Specializes in creating concise summaries")
    .withInstruction("You are a summary specialist. Create clear, well-structured summaries from research findings.")
    .build();

  // Sequential workflow: Research → Summarize
  const { runner, session } = await AgentBuilder
    .create("research_workflow")
    .withDescription("A workflow that researches and then summarizes")
    .asSequential([researchAgent.agent, summaryAgent.agent])
    .withQuickSession("research-app", "user-123")
    .build();

  if (!runner || !session) {
    throw new Error("Failed to create workflow");
  }

  // Execute sequential workflow
  for await (const event of runner.runAsync({
    userId: "user-123",
    sessionId: session.id,
    newMessage: {
      parts: [{ text: "Research the latest developments in TypeScript 5.0 and provide a summary" }]
    }
  })) {
    if (event.content?.parts?.[0]?.text && !event.partial) {
      console.log(`[${event.author}]: ${event.content.parts[0].text}`);
    }
  }

  // Parallel execution example
  console.log("\n--- Parallel Analysis ---");
  
  const [technicalAnalysis, businessAnalysis] = await Promise.all([
    AgentBuilder
      .create("tech_analyst")
      .withModel("gpt-4")
      .withInstruction("Analyze technical aspects: algorithms, implementation, performance.")
      .ask("Analyze the technical aspects of AI in healthcare"),
    
    AgentBuilder
      .create("business_analyst")
      .withModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
      .withInstruction("Analyze business aspects: market impact, ROI, adoption barriers.")
      .ask("Analyze the business aspects of AI in healthcare")
  ]);

  console.log("Technical Analysis:", technicalAnalysis);
  console.log("Business Analysis:", businessAnalysis);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Traditional Agent Creation (Advanced)
For users who need fine-grained control over agent configuration, ADK also supports traditional agent creation:

```typescript
import { LlmAgent, Runner, InMemorySessionService } from '@iqai/adk';

// Traditional approach with explicit configuration
const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: "custom_agent",
  model: "gpt-4",
  description: "A custom agent",
  instruction: "You are a helpful assistant."
});

const sessionService = new InMemorySessionService();
const runner = new Runner({
  appName: "my-app",
  agent,
  sessionService
});

// Use with explicit session management...
```

This approach provides maximum flexibility for complex use cases but requires more boilerplate code.
